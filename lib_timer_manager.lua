--
--- @set_environment battle
--- @set_environment campaign
--- @set_environment frontend
--- @c timer_manager Timer Manager
--- @desc The timer manager object provides library support for calling functions with a time interval i.e. waiting one second before calling a function. It is loaded in all game modes and provides similar but not identical functionality in each.
--- @desc It is rare for game scripts to need direct access to the timer manager. The timer manager is automatically created as the script libraries are loaded, and both the @battle_manager and @campaign_manager provide pass-through functions to the timer manager which game scripts typically use instead of calling the timer manager directly. For the campaign these functions are documented in the @"campaign_manager:Timer Callbacks" section of this documentation, and in battle they are documented here: @"battle_manager:Timer Callbacks".
--- @desc Direct access to the timer manager might be more useful for frontend scripts, but they are rarer in themselves. The core function @core:get_tm can be used to get a handle to the timer manager after it has been created.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- @section Campaign
--- @desc The campaign construction function @timer_manager:new_campaign is automatically called by the @campaign_manager during the loading sequence (when the <code>WorldCreated</code> model event is received), so there should be no need for client scripts to call it.
--- @desc The mechanics of the underlying campaign model timing system is very different to the equivalent system in battle. As such, the campaign constructor provides versions of @timer_manager:callback, @timer_manager:repeat_callback and @timer_manager:remove_callback which are different from those provided in battle. The usage of the campaign version of these functions is the same as for battle, with the key difference that model time in campaign is expressed in <strong>seconds</strong> in campaign and <strong>milliseconds</strong> in battle. @"timer_manager:Real Timers" use milliseconds in all game modes.
--- @desc During the end-turn sequence the update rate of the campaign model can accelerate wildly. This will cause a function registered to be called after five seconds to happen near-instantly during the end turn sequence, for example. To ameliorate this effect, the timer manager will automatically check the real world time once the interval has completed. If the real world time is less than would be expected then the callback is retried repeatedly until the real world interval has elapsed. This behaviour is only active in singleplayer mode as it would cause desyncs in multiplayer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- @function new_campaign
--- @desc Creates and returns a timer manager in campaign. This function should be supplied a <code>game_interface</code>, which requires that it is created when the <code>NewSession</code> script event is received (or later).

--- @section Frontend
--- @desc The frontend-specific constructor @timer_manager:new_frontend is automatically called in <code>lib_header.lua</code> as it's loaded, so there should be no need for client scripts to call it.
--- @desc There is no game model to provide timer functionality in the frontend, so only the real timer is available. The frontend-specific constructor creates @timer_manager:callback, @timer_manager:repeat_callback and @timer_manager:remove_callback functions but these remap to @timer_manager:real_callback, @timer_manager:repeat_real_callback and @timer_manager:remove_callback respectively.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	return tm;
end;










----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- @section Model Timers
--- @desc Model timers are synchronised to the game model in campaign and battle. They are the main timers used by game scripts. Both the campaign manager and battle manager provide pass-through interfaces to the functionality documented here - see @"campaign_manager:Timer Callbacks" (campaign) and @"battle_manager:Timer Callbacks" (battle). It is intended that game scripts call these pass-through functions rather than the timer manager itself.
--- @desc When a callback is created with an interval of one second, then the callback function would be called as part of a model update where at least one second of model time has elapsed. This means:<ul>
--- @desc <li>Model timers are confined to the resolution of the game model update, which is currently between 100ms and 200ms. A model timer callback with an interval of 250ms, for example, would not be called until the following model tick, at 300-400ms after the callback was created.</li>
--- @desc <li>Model updates will speed up and slow down in battle if the player changes their battle speed, and also speed up a lot during the end turn sequence in battle. Model updates are also stopped when the game is paused. For these reasons a model timer callback of one second cannot be relied on to trigger after one second has passed in the real world. See @"timer_manager:Real Timers" for callback functions linked to a timer synchronised to real time.</li>
--- @desc <li>As model updates are synchronised between all clients in a multiplayer game, so too are model timers.</li>
--- @desc <li>There is no game model present in the frontend, so only real timers are available. The functions @timer_manager:callback, @timer_manager:repeat_callback and @timer_manager:remove_callback are available in the frontend but will redirect to the real timer equivalents.</li></ul>
--- @desc It is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that game scripts rely on model timers as their primary mode of script timing, and only use real timers in certain specific situations, usually to do with UI manipulation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


-- NB: implementations of the functions in this section are provided within the various game mode constructors - new_campaign, new_battle and new_frontend - as each game mode implements model timers very differently.


--- @function callback
--- @desc Adds a model callback to be called after the supplied interval has elapsed.
--- @p @function callback, Callback to call.
--- @p @number interval, Interval after which to call the callback. This should be in milliseconds in battle and in the frontend, and in seconds in campaign.
--- @p [opt=nil] @string name, Callback name, by which it may be later removed with @timer_manager:remove_callback. If omitted the callback may not be cancelled.



--- @function repeat_callback
--- @desc Adds a repeating model callback to be called each time the supplied interval elapses.
--- @p @function callback, Callback to call.
--- @p @number interval, Interval after which to call the callback. This should be in milliseconds in battle and in the frontend, and in seconds in campaign.
--- @p [opt=nil] @string name, Callback name, by which it may be later removed with @timer_manager:remove_callback. If omitted the repeating callback may not be cancelled.


--- @function remove_callback
--- @desc Removes a real callback previously added with @timer_manager:callback or @timer_manager:repeat_callback by name. All callbacks with a name matching that supplied will be cancelled and removed.
--- @p @string name, Name of callback to remove.










----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- @section Real Timers
--- @desc Real timers are synchronised to user-interface updates rather than game model updates, like @"timer_manager:Model Timers". In practice, this means:<ul>
--- @desc <li>Real timers continue to tick and will call their callback even if model updates are paused (e.g. the game is paused in battle).</li>
--- @desc <li>Real timers do not change speed with the model (in battle, and also in campaign during the end-turn sequence).</li>
--- @desc <li>Real timers can have a resolution greater than a model tick (100-200ms).</li>
--- @desc <li>Real timers have a variable resolution - as the frame rate changes, so does the frequency with which real timers get checked.</li>
--- @desc <li>Real timers work in the frontend where no game model is present.</li>
--- @desc <li>Synchronicity between different clients in a multiplayer game cannot be guaranteed (and is highly unlikely to be achieved).</li>
--- @desc <li>Due to the lack of synchronisation between the real timer and the model, the latter may not be in a suitable state to be queried when a real timer is called.</li></ul>
--- @desc It is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that game scripts rely on model timers as their primary mode of script timing, and only use real timers in certain specific situations, usually to do with UI manipulation.
